=======================

#Ansible playbook for docker-registry

This is an [Ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com/) playbook for [Docker registry](https://www.docker.com/). You can use it by itself or as part of a larger playbook customized for your local environment.

Steps
-----

## Testing locally with Vagrant
A sample [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) configuration is provided to help with local testing. After installing Vagrant, run `vagrant up` at the root of the project to get a VM instance bootstrapped and configured with a running instance of docker registry.

## Include role in a larger playbook
### Add this role as a git submodule
Assuming your playbook structure is such as:
```
- my-master-playbook
  |- vars
  |- roles
  |- my-master-playbook-main.yml
  \- my-master-inventory.ini
```

Checkout this project as a submodule under roles:

```
$  cd roles
$  git submodule add git://github.com/fupelaqu/ansible-docker-registry.git ./docker-registry
$  git submodule update --init
$  git commit ./docker-registry -m "Added ansible-docker-registry as ./docker-registry"
```

### Include this playbook as a role in your master playbook
Example `my-master-playbook-main.yml`:

```
